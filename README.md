## The Crypto Crib

The files in this repository are the initial documents for a cryptocurrency website.

Access the site at http://thecryptocrib.com and be aware that this is not a secure site. It is advised that you do not enter live personal information in the form fields.

The following project requirements have been met:

- The site is responsive with media queries for tablet and mobile devices.
- There are at least 25 commits to the repository.
- There are four JavaScript requirements within the site as follows:

  1.  Current date is displayed at the top of the page, and there is a countdown timer displayed for an event in October:
      ![date](media/readme_date.png)
  2.  An array was created, populated with multiple values which are all retrieved and displayed in the completed "How much did you learn?" quiz:
      ![array](media/readme_array.png)
      ![quiz](media/readme_quiz.png)
  3.  A form was created to collect name and email. A regular expression (regex) was used to verify the correct formatting of the email address with notification to the user of an Invalid email address!:
      ![regex](media/readme_regex.png)
      or a confirmation message for a valid email address:
      ![regex2](media/readme_regex2.png)
  4.  The same form, when submitted, will generate a local file in JSON format (cryptoFormData.txt) with the first name, last name, and email text:
      ![form_data](media/readme_form_data.png)

Next steps for this project would be to develop the educational content and the sub pages as well as improving the functionality and design for an ideal user experience.<br>
