          Crypto is short for Cryptography which is the study or process of creating secret code.
          Crypto is also short for Cryptocurrency which is a digital currency that utilizes
          cryptography and a decentralized monetary system.<br>
          <br>
          What is a crib?  A baby’s cradle?  A place to crash for the night?<br>
          <br>
          As described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack" style="color: lightblue; text-decoration:none">Wikipedia</a>, a crib is “a plain language (or code) passage of any length,
          usually obtained by solving one or more cipher or code messages, and occurring or believed
          likely to occur in a different cipher or code message, which it may provide a means of
          solving.”<br>
          <br>
          Cribbing means to figure out the crib after it has been encoded as ciphertext (secret code). But you have to know some partial information about the crib,
          such as it’s first or last character or how many characters it has in total.
          A Crypto Crib, therefore, is a place for your Bitcoin to crash, right?<br>
          <br>
          Not really. It just means we are going to discuss the secrets of cryptocurrencies - right here in The Crypto Crib.

            <h3>Crypto Terms</h3>
            <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> – digital currency that is
            represented by a token and held for investment or traded on a
            blockchain network.<br></br>
            <strong>Altcoin</strong> – any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin.
            There are over 9,000 altcoins as of 2021.<br></br>
            <strong>Bitcoin (symbol: BTC)</strong> – launched in 2009 by
            Satoshi Nakamoto as a platform for peer-to-peer electronic cash
            transactions. Bitcoin solved the problem of double spending
            through its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.<br></br>
            <strong>Blockchain Technology</strong> – a decentralized
            distributed ledger system that powers cryptocurrency transactions
            and smart contracts. Transaction records are simultaneously stored
            on multiple computers called nodes that are located throughout the
            world. Every node must validate and agree on every transaction
            which results in a secure blockchain network. Transactions on a
            blockchain network are immutable which means they are not able to
            be changed.<br></br>
            <strong>Smart contract</strong> – a self-executing contract
            between two or more parties with terms written into the code,
            including event triggers to automatically execute those terms.
            <br></br>
            <strong>Digital Wallet</strong>– aka crypto wallet, hot wallet,
            soft wallet, hard wallet, cold wallet – examples of hot/cold
            <br></br>
            <strong>Double spending</strong> – In digital cash, the potential
            of someone spending the same token twice.<br></br>
            <strong>Ethereum (symbol: ETH)</strong> – Proof-of-Work
            cryptocurrency that is also a platform for other decentralized
            applications to build on<br></br>
            <strong>DeFi</strong> (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for
            financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With
            DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn
            interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade
            assets, and more — but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork
            or a third party. - Coinbase, July 2021.
            <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> – creator of Bitcoin, author of
            the Bitcoin white paper; famously unknown – could be a man, a
            woman, or a group of people

            <h3>Bitcoin</h3>
            Bitcoin is the world’s original cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin
            white paper in 2008, and the coin was launched in 2009. The first Bitcoin transaction took
            place in 2010 when a Florida man, Laszlo Hanyez, paid 10,000 Bitcoins to a man in Great Britain
            who agreed to buy two large Papa John’s pizza for the Mr. Hanyez. The transaction was worth $41
            at the time but would be worth over $300 million in 2021. Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22 was named
            in honor of this first transaction and celebrated every year.<br>
