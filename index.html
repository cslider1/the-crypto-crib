          <h3>Crypto Terms</h3>
          <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> – digital currency that is
          represented by a token and held for investment or traded on a
          blockchain network.<br></br>
          <strong>Altcoin</strong> – any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin.
          There are over 9,000 altcoins as of 2021.<br></br>
          <strong>Bitcoin (symbol: BTC)</strong> – launched in 2009 by
          Satoshi Nakamoto as a platform for peer-to-peer electronic cash
          transactions. Bitcoin solved the problem of double spending
          through its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.<br></br>
          <strong>Blockchain Technology</strong> – a decentralized
          distributed ledger system that powers cryptocurrency transactions
          and smart contracts. Transaction records are simultaneously stored
          on multiple computers called nodes that are located throughout the
          world. Every node must validate and agree on every transaction
          which results in a secure blockchain network. Transactions on a
          blockchain network are immutable which means they are not able to
          be changed.<br></br>
          <strong>Smart contract</strong> – a self-executing contract
          between two or more parties with terms written into the code,
          including event triggers to automatically execute those terms.
          <br></br>
          <strong>Digital Wallet</strong>– aka crypto wallet, hot wallet,
          soft wallet, hard wallet, cold wallet – examples of hot/cold
          <br></br>
          <strong>Double spending</strong> – In digital cash, the potential
          of someone spending the same token twice.<br></br>
          <strong>Ethereum (symbol: ETH)</strong> – Proof-of-Work
          cryptocurrency that is also a platform for other decentralized
          applications to build on<br></br>
          <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> – creator of Bitcoin, author of
          the Bitcoin white paper; famously unknown – could be a man, a
          woman, or a group of people

          <h3>What is a Crypto Portfolio?</h3>

          <h3>What is DeFi?</h3>
          DeFi (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for
          financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With
          DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn
          interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade
          assets, and more — but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork
          or a third party. - Coinbase, July 2021.
